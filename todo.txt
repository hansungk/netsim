* BUGS
- A simple tornado traffic on a 1-D ring stalls simulation with
  input_buf_size >= 8. --> DEADLOCK??

* TODO
- Infinite source queue and accurate terminal instrumentation
- Topology for 2-D torus
- Routing for 2-D torus
- Wormhole -> VC flow control
- Deadlock avoidance
  - Dedicated/free VCs

* Showcasing
- Event-driven: show simulator does not progress further after
  deadlock

* Latency model
- "ready" bit?
  - Closely resembles HW implementation
  - Simpler, but may be too low level? This is basically how HDLs do
    it.
- Event queue?
  - Probably the most popular method. (gem5, MARSSx86)
  - How do we combine this with a detailed cycle-accurate OoO engine?
    Doesn't an OoO engine always do _something_ at every cycle?
- Latency object?
  - Basically what SimpleScalar does
  - Return <lat, value> pair from access functions
  - Maybe useful in implementing 'oracle', ahead-of-time simulation features
  - More complicated code
- FIFO queues?
  - Overkill?
